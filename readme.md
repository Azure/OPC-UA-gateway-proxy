# OPC Proxy

You find the [OPC Proxy sources](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-opc-proxy/tree/master) in this repository.   

If you are looking for a way to connect OPC UA devices to Azure, we recommend to use the **OPC Twin module**, which is faster, has more features, and works with Azure IoT Edge.

OPC Twin is part of the Industrial IoT Platform which can be found @[Azure/Industrial-IoT](https://github.com/Azure/Industrial-IoT).
